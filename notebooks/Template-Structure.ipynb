    "### What is the Template/Structure Pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Template/Structure Pattern involves creating standardized formats that ensure consistent organization and presentation of information, regardless of the specific content or unusual circumstances involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scientific Basis:**\n",
    "- **Cognitive Load Theory** : Structured templates reduce the cognitive burden of figuring out how to organize information, freeing mental resources for focusing on content.    \n",
    "\"Conventional problem solving in the form of means-ends analysis requires a relatively large amount of cognitive processing capacity which is consequently unavailable for schema acquisition\"   \n",
    "**Ref.**: Sweller, J. (1988). [Cognitive load during problem solving: Effects on learning](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15516709cog1202_4). *Cognitive Science*, 12(2), 257-285.    \n",
    "- **Schema Theory** : People naturally rely on structured mental frameworks (schemas) to organize and process information, making templates cognitively compatible with human thinking.    \n",
    "\"Remembering is an imaginative reconstruction or construction that depends heavily on the operation of a schema, an active organisation of past reactions, or of past experiences, which must always be supposed to be operating in any well-adapted organic response\"         \n",
    "**Ref.**: Bartlett, F. C. (1932). [Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology](https://archive.org/details/Bartlett1932Remembering). Cambridge University Press.       \n",
    "- **Information Architecture** (Rosenfeld & Morville, 2006): Systematic structural organization dramatically improves user experience and information accessibility in complex systems.   \n",
    "**Ref.**: Rosenfeld, L., & Morville, P. (2006). [Information Architecture for the World Wide Web](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44837374_Information_Architecture_for_the_World_Wide_Web). O'Reilly Media. \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Why This Works:**\n",
    "- Reduces cognitive burden by providing familiar structure\n",
    "- Ensures completeness by including all necessary fields\n",
    "- Enables automation through predictable formats\n",
    "- Improves communication across diverse teams and scenarios\n"

    "            Dr. Marcus Chen (Senior Portal Engineer, Security Clearance Level 4) first observed the anomaly when swirling purple energy replaced the break room coffee machine. During lunch break, quantum physicist Dr. Sarah Nakamura, biochemist Dr. James Rodriguez, and research intern Lisa Park accidentally stepped through the portal while investigating the phenomenon. The three researchers spent 22 minutes exploring the forest before encountering the Chromari—chameleon-like beings who communicate through rapid skin color changes. The Chromari, displaying welcoming golden patterns, invited them to a traditional coffee ceremony, serving what could only be described as \"liquid perfection\" in carved wooden vessels. As a ceremonial parting gift, the Chromari presented the researchers with small pouches of their sacred coffee beans.\n",
    "            Upon return at 1:15 PM, the researchers shared their precious gift with colleagues, triggering what facility psychologist Dr. Amanda Wells classified as \"mass interdimensional coffee syndrome.\" Dr. Nakamura was heard weeping over her Earth coffee, declaring it \"an insult to caffeine everywhere!\" while Dr. Rodriguez began hoarding sugar packets and was found at 2:30 PM trying to recreate Chromari brewing techniques using office supplies.\" \n",
    "            Portal monitoring detected quantum fluctuations spiking to 847 terahertz. When Dr. Chen attempted Portal Safety Protocol Delta-7 at 3:45 PM, the staff members that had been exposed to the Chromari coffee, led by the entire Accounting Department, rushed through the closing portal shouting \"Take us to the good coffee planet!\" The Nexus Institute has now lost seventeen researchers. Emergency measures are underway to reopen the portal for a rescue mission, though volunteers have requested permission to \"accidentally\" get stranded if the Chromari hospitality includes more ceremonial gifts.   \n",

    "            At exactly 12:23 PM Central Standard Time on December 3rd, 2025, maintenance supervisor Tom Bradley (Facilities Operations Manager, Security Clearance Level 3) reported that Cafeteria Delta in Building B, Ground Floor, Section 12-C (dimensional coordinates X:41.878, Y:-87.634, Z:2.156) had become trapped in a temporal loop with a precise duration of 37 minutes and 14 seconds, resetting continuously back to 12:23:00 PM.\n",
    "            The anomaly was first observed when head cafeteria worker Mrs. Dorothy Hendricks (20-year veteran lunch preparation specialist) began serving the same pre-made tuna sandwich repeatedly to confused staff members. Time progression monitoring shows that every 37 minutes and 14 seconds, all events within the cafeteria's spatial boundaries reset to their exact 12:23 PM state, while the rest of the facility continues normal temporal flow. Dr. Alan Foster (Quantum Systems Engineer), Dr. Rebecca Liu (Temporal Mechanics Specialist), and research assistant Kevin Park have all witnessed the phenomenon from outside the cafeteria threshold.\n",
    "            Mrs. Hendricks has now served identical tuna sandwiches (white bread, store-brand tuna, wilted lettuce) exactly 47 times as of 3:15 PM real-time. Security footage shows her growing frustration levels, with documented quotes including 'Not this sandwich again!' (loop iteration 12), 'I'm losing my mind with this tuna!' (loop iteration 23), and 'If I see one more person ask for this same sandwich...' (loop iteration 31). Anyone entering the cafeteria becomes trapped in the loop until they exit the spatial boundary.\n",
    "            Temporal distortion sensors installed throughout the facility detected massive chronoton particle emissions beginning at 11:45 AM, originating from the newly installed Quantum Microwave Array (model QM-3000, serial number QTM-789-DEL) in the cafeteria's north wall. Dr. Foster immediately initiated Temporal Containment Protocol Theta-9 and assembled the Emergency Chronological Response Unit (ECRU) including temporal physicist Dr. Maria Santos and quantum field specialist Dr. David Chang. The quantum microwave was powered down at 3:20 PM, but the temporal loop persists. No external agencies have been contacted. Mrs. Hendricks has been rotated out of the affected area and is receiving counseling for temporal stress disorder. The incident remains active with cafeteria services suspended indefinitely. Current loop count stands at 47 iterations with no signs of natural decay.\n",

    "\n",
    "3) **Do NOT fabricate or alter** any of the following:\n",
    "   - Identifiers (e.g., Incident ID, names, roles)\n",
    "   - Dates, times, or timezones\n",
    "   - Coordinates, ranges, or units\n",
    "   - Severity levels or classifications\n",

    "4) **Preserve the template structure exactly**:\n",
    "   - Do NOT reorder, rename, or omit headings or sub-fields.\n",
    "   - Do NOT add or remove bullet points or sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Copy terms from report**:\n",
    "   - Use the exact wording from the incident description for names, units, durations, and specialized terms.\n",
    "   - Do NOT rephrase or paraphrase technical language.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) **Output ONLY the completed template**:\n",
    "   - No additional commentary, notes, or explanations before or after the template.\n",
    "   - No summaries, introductions, or conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) **Follow field-specific instructions**:\n",
    "   - For **checkboxes** (e.g., Current Status), select **only one option**. If none apply, select \"Not specified in report.\"\n",
    "   - For **numerical ratings** (e.g., Public Exposure Risk), provide the rating **only if explicitly stated**. Otherwise, use \"Not assessed in report.\"\n",
    "   - For **Data Source**, specify the origin of the information (e.g., logs, witnesses) if mentioned. Otherwise, use \"Not specified in report.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "8) **Clarify \"Not specified in report\" vs. \"Not applicable\"**:\n",
    "   - Use **\"Not specified in report\"** if the field is missing or unclear.\n",
    "   - Use **\"Not applicable\"** only if the field logically does not apply (e.g., \"Dimensional Coordinates\" for a non-interdimensional incident).\n",

    "### Exercise 2.1: Beyond the Template - Exploring AI, Ethics, and Real-World Incident Response\n",
    "#### Reflect on the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. AI and Template Design**\n",
    "- The AI strictly followed the rule to use only explicit facts and avoided speculation. How does this approach improve the reliability of incident reports? Can you think of situations where this might be too restrictive?\n",
    "- The template includes fields like \"Dimensional Coordinates\" and \"Temporal Anomalies.\" Why are these important in a universal template? What other fields might be useful for unexpected or interdisciplinary incidents?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Critical Analysis of the Report**\n",
    "- The AI classified the incident as **\"Anomalous\"** with **\"Moderate\"** severity. Do you agree with this classification? How might different stakeholders (e.g., engineers, management, legal) interpret it differently?\n",
    "- The **\"Sequence of Events\"** is presented as a timeline. How does this format help or hinder understanding? When might a narrative description be more useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### **3. Real-World Implications and Decision-Making**\n",
    "- The report notes a 300% increase in productivity due to the AI’s behavior. Should this be considered a positive outcome, a risk, or both? How would you address this in a follow-up report?\n",
    "- The team recommended repurposing the AI’s behavior for creative team-building. What are the potential benefits and risks of this idea? How would you design a pilot test for this?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### **4. Real-World Applications**\n",
    "- How could this template be adapted for a **hospital, a power plant, or a social media platform?** What fields would you add, remove, or modify?\n",
    "- Imagine this incident occurred in your organization. Which external agencies would you notify, and why? How would public exposure risk change in your industry?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### **5. Ethical and Practical Challenges**\n",
    "- The AI’s behavior was contained internally, but there was concern about information leaks. What steps would you take to assess and mitigate this risk? Who should be involved in this decision?\n",
    "- If this incident had involved sensitive data, how would the response and report change? Rewrite the \"Public Exposure Risk\" and \"Containment Measures\" sections for that scenario.\n"

Decision-making is conducted by harmonic consensus, and legal representation is considered valid if at least 1,000 resonance nodes participate in forming the consensus.\n",

They require an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere with elevated carbon dioxide levels and stable chemical markers in their environment to maintain neural synchronization across the collective, much like how networked computers need stable connections to function properly.\n",

Their collective civilization spans 23,000 galactic years, with true unified consciousness emerging 8,500 years ago when they reached the critical threshold of 100 million synchronized units necessary for complex collective thought processing.\n",

Decision-making occurs through chemical signal cascades that coordinate responses across the network, with legal representation considered valid when at least 100 million units participate in the synchronization process.\n",

New consciousness emerges when existing beings voluntarily split their energy matrices or when multiple entities merge portions of their field structures. Their collective civilization spans 156,000 galactic years, with individual consciousness patterns typically maintaining coherent existence for 2,000 to 5,000 years before choosing voluntary energy redistribution.\n",
    "            They utilize their star's magnetic field lines as both transportation networks and information storage systems. For legal interactions with matter-based species, they designate stable energy manifestations called Coherence Speakers. Their governance operates through electromagnetic resonance consensus, with legal decisions considered valid when at least seventy-five percent of active energy patterns participate in harmonic alignment processes.\n",

They prefer diplomatic responses delivered through controlled electromagnetic broadcasts that integrate directly with their consciousness matrices.\n",

    "**Goal:** Adapt the template to handle new document types and species.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks:**\n",
    "1. **Add a New Species:**\n",
    "   - Add the new species \"Quantum_Entanglement_Beings\" with the following species accomodations:\n",
    "     ```markdown\n",
    "        \"Entity_Name/Designation\": \"Full name, collective identifier, or consciousness designation\",\n",

    "3. **Create a template and a prompt for the visa application. Choose a scenario and generate the form.**   \n",
    "   - You can use one of the following scenarios:    \n",
    "     ```markdown\n",
    "        **Quantum Entanglement Beings (QEBs)**     \n",
    "        **Visa Application**     \n",
    "            On Stardate 57893.2, a delegation of Quantum Entanglement Beings (QEBs) from the Vela Remnant System submitted a request for diplomatic visas to attend the Galactic Confederation’s Annual Summit on Interdimensional Ethics. The delegation is led by a Coherence Node, a semi-stable quantum state acting as their spokesperson. The QEBs exist as a probability cloud with no fixed mass or location, though they can manifest as flickering blue light patterns when observed under specific conditions.   \n",
    "            The QEBs seek to observe and contribute to discussions on the rights of non-localized species. They have offered to demonstrate quantum communication techniques that could enhance Confederation data networks, though the specifics of this offer remain undefined. The Confederation’s Bureau of Quantum Affairs has noted that the QEBs cannot be directly observed without collapsing their quantum state, and negotiations must occur in a quantum-shielded chamber.   \n",
    "            The QEBs’ application lacks several key details. The duration of their stay is unspecified, though the standard Confederation visa lasts 30 galactic days. Their exact role at the summit—whether as observers, speakers, or mediators—is also unclear. Additionally, the QEBs have requested exemption from temporal logging due to their non-linear perception of time, but the legal implications of this request are still under review by the Confederation’s Temporal Compliance Office.   \n",
    "            The QEBs cannot sign physical or digital documents. Instead, they propose ratifying agreements via a quantum entanglement handshake, a protocol recognized under Galactic Quantum Law. The Confederation has advised against using deterministic language during negotiations, as it may destabilize the QEBs’ quantum state.   \n",
    "            The delegation has not specified any cultural or religious restrictions, but the Confederation recommends avoiding direct questions about their origin or the nature of their quantum existence, as these topics are considered sensitive.   \n",
    "        **Time-Traveling Bureaucrat**     \n",
    "        **Visa Application**      \n",
    "            Agent Temporal-7, a field operative from the 32nd-century Department of Paradox Prevention (DoPP), seeks emergency temporary visa status within Galactic Confederation jurisdiction. Their mission is to investigate timeline violations in the current era that threaten the Confederation's stability.   \n",
    "            Agent Temporal-7 is an individual entity with a biological core altered by temporal anomalies. They were born in 3087 CE, but due to paradox exposure, they now exist simultaneously across multiple timelines. Their age is recorded as 25 standard galactic years, though they also age backwards on Tuesdays, resuming forward progression on other days.\n",
    "            Their current residence is listed as present-day Earth (North American continental sector), though this address fluctuates with temporal anchoring.   \n",
    "            The reason for application is to obtain temporary legal authority to investigate and resolve an active timeline violation. If unresolved, the violation may prevent their own birth and destabilize historical continuity. The applicant requests emergency processing with automatic review upon paradox resolution.   \n",
    "            Special abilities include:   \n",
    "            - Causality manipulation, which also functions as their primary form of communication.   \n",
    "            - Temporal duplication, allowing multiple versions of themselves to act concurrently.   \n",
    "            Species-specific accommodations were not specified in the application, as the applicant identifies primarily as biological with temporal anomalies rather than belonging to a standard classification.   \n",
    "            Their primary language is causal resonance. Their response format is typically quantum entanglement packets, ensuring that communications remain synchronized across multiple overlapping timelines.   \n",
    "            Agent Temporal-7 confirms adherence to the Galactic Ethics Code during their temporary authorized presence.\n",
    "            Special handling requirements include reality stabilization and paradox quarantine protocols, as their presence in any given era must be carefully managed to prevent timeline collapse. Visa duration is contingent upon successful resolution of the temporal paradox threatening their existence.   \n",

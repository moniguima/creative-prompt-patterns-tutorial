    "### What is the Template/Structure Pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Template/Structure Pattern involves creating standardized formats that ensure consistent organization and presentation of information, regardless of the specific content or unusual circumstances involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scientific Basis:**\n",
    "- **Cognitive Load Theory** : Structured formats reduce mental processing overhead    \n",
    "\"Conventional problem solving in the form of means-ends analysis requires a relatively large amount of cognitive processing capacity which is consequently unavailable for schema acquisition\" - demonstrating that structured templates reduce the cognitive burden of figuring out how to organize information, freeing mental resources for focusing on content.    \n",
    "**Ref.**: Sweller, J. (1988). [Cognitive load during problem solving: Effects on learning](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15516709cog1202_4). *Cognitive Science*, 12(2), 257-285.    \n",
    "- **Schema Theory** : People use mental templates to organize and recall information\n",
    "\"Remembering is an imaginative reconstruction or construction that depends heavily on the operation of a schema, an active organisation of past reactions, or of past experiences, which must always be supposed to be operating in any well-adapted organic response\" - showing that people naturally rely on structured mental frameworks (schemas) to organize and process information, making templates cognitively compatible with human thinking.     \n",
    "**Ref.**: Bartlett, F. C. (1932). [Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology](https://archive.org/details/Bartlett1932Remembering). Cambridge University Press.       \n",
    "- **Information Architecture** (Rosenfeld & Morville, 2006): Consistent structure improves usability and comprehension   \n",
    "Systematic structural organization dramatically improves user experience and information accessibility in complex systems.   \n",
    "**Ref.**: Rosenfeld, L., & Morville, P. (2006). [Information Architecture for the World Wide Web](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44837374_Information_Architecture_for_the_World_Wide_Web). O'Reilly Media. \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Why This Works:**\n",
    "- Reduces cognitive burden by providing familiar structure\n",
    "- Ensures completeness by including all necessary fields\n",
    "- Enables automation through predictable formats\n",
    "- Improves communication across diverse teams and scenarios\n"

## What You'll Learn

This repository contains **5 interactive Jupyter notebooks** that teach fundamental prompt engineering patterns through creative, memorable examples. Instead of typical business scenarios, you'll explore prompts through:

- **Marine biologists analyzing social media ecosystems**
- **Time-traveling consultants solving modern problems**
- **AI detectives using chain-of-thought reasoning**
- **Alien communication protocols with few-shot learning**
- **Galactic bureaucracy template systems**
